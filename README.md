#  Automated Inventory Verification and Tracking System for Warehouses

---

##  Abstract

Manual warehouse inventory tracking is error-prone and inefficient. This project presents an **Automated Inventory Verification and Tracking System** using **IoT, cloud connectivity (Firebase), and mobile application support**. It automatically verifies incoming products using RFID, assigns storage slots, and provides real-time tracking via a custom Android app. The system reduces human error, improves speed, and enhances warehouse scalability through ESP32 microcontroller-based automation.

##  Objectives

- Automate product verification using **RFID technology**
- Assign and display **slot numbers** for verified products
- Provide **real-time inventory updates** using **Firebase**
- Control **servo-operated gates** based on IR detection
- Enable **remote monitoring** via an Android app
- Minimize human error in product handling
- Build a **scalable system** for future expansion

---

##  Methodology

The system works as follows:

1. A product is placed on the conveyor and detected by the first **IR sensor**
2. The **RFID reader** scans the product's NFC tag
3. The product ID is verified against a **Firebase** cloud database
4. If valid, a slot number is assigned and displayed on a **16x2 LCD**
5. A second IR sensor detects the product at the gate
6. A **servo motor** opens the gate to direct the product to its slot
7. The product is tracked via a **mobile app** built using Kotlin and XML

##  Conclusion

The proposed system successfully automates warehouse operations by using a combination of **RFID verification**, **cloud integration**, and **servo-controlled sorting**. Real-time data synchronization with Firebase ensures accurate inventory management, while the mobile app makes monitoring accessible from anywhere.

Future enhancements can include:
- Multi-lane support
- Motorized conveyor automation
- Obstacle detection with additional sensors

This scalable system can significantly benefit warehouses, logistics centers, and industrial storage environments.
